# Introduction to Algorithms (3rd Edition)
Just me, working through the pseudocode for Intro to Algorithms, in Go. Each chapter is represented as a package,
and I just run individual algorithms out of main as I please.

# Why GO?
Because it is neat, it's a decent systems replacement for C, and has pointers (without the pointer arithmetic!) I
also want to get better at my Go fundamentals, because it's a very useful language due to it's simplicity and
massive standard library.

# Notes
The pseudocode in Introduction to Algorithms is 1-indexed, so some changes occasionally have to be made to make
due in a 0-indexed language. Why they 1-indexed the pseudocode, I don't know (because ALGOL?).
